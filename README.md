# Rubyfy for Rails
[Rubyfy](https://github.com/calebkm/rubyfy) brings some of the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en) methods you miss in JavaScript to your [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) app.

## Installation
Add Rubyfy to your gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'rubyfy-rails'
```
Inside of your `application.js` file add the line:
```javascript
//= require rubyfy
```
And wham-bam you can now call `[1, 2, 3].last()` in your JS code and get `3` returned to you!

## Why?
The `rubyfy-rails` gem makes it easy to add [Rubyfy](https://github.com/calebkm/rubyfy) to your Rails app. If you're like me, you might miss some of the Ruby methods you love when coding in JavaScript.

## Configuration + Methods
Check out config options and a full list of available methods in the [Rubyfy README](https://github.com/calebkm/rubyfy).
